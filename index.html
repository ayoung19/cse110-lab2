                    Hey! I’m Andy Young, a second year Computer Engineering major from Honolulu, Hawaii! I’ve been programming as a hobby
                    since my freshman year of high school and am lucky to have gained a lot of software and web development experiences and
                    skills as a result. I’m very grateful to be able to pursue my passion as a career and solve all interesting problems the
                    field has to offer.
                </p>

                <h3>Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    Since there are requirements I have to fill for this assignment, I figured I could just include a few of my projects
                    from my resume to knock some of them down:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://torystimesheet.com/">Tory Roofing</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Automated and digitized Tory Roofing’s employee/job management system and payroll process by developing a webapp using
                                <b>Ruby on Rails</b> that allows foreman to submit timesheets on an intuitive mobile UI and managers to review and
                                automatically perform the payroll every week.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opgg-summoner-search/dfnoddgekoeiljeaekobnchnedoipgpc?hl=en">OP.GG Search</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Created a Chrome extension with <b>JavaScript</b> as a freshman in high school, which currently has 5,000+ users, that adds
                                extra features to a League of Legends statistics website.
                            </li>

                <p>
                    To demonstrate unordered lists, here are some video games that I like to play!

                        <li><i>League of Legends</i></li>

                <h3>New Year’s Bucket List</h3>
                <p>
                    Because of how badly I’ve personally responded to quarantine, instead of having a list of New Year’s resolutions, I have
                    a very low-expectation bucket list for this year that’ll hopefully help push me to getting my life back together:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <input type="checkbox" checked disabled>
                        <label>Attend a remote class</label>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <input type="checkbox" disabled>
                        <label>Surf</label>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <input type="checkbox" disabled>
                        <label>Go to the gym</label>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <input type="checkbox" checked disabled>
                        <label>Refuse to eat junk food when tempted</label>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <input type="checkbox" disabled>
                        <label>Write a line of code in Haskell</label>
                    </li>

                <h3>SWE Advice</h3>
                <p>
                    Here’s a wise quote:

                    <blockquote>
                        <i>Code is read more often than it is written.</i>
                    </blockquote>

                    Not sure who said it first, but it’s definitely been said and at least thousands of times by many different which makes
                    me wonder why there is still so much bad code… Consider this snippet below, written “cleanly” by me because it takes up
                    “such few lines”, can you tell what it does?

                    <pre><code>
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1

    for i in range(1, len(dp)):
        for n in nums:
            if n <= i:
                dp[i] +=dp[i - n]
    
    return dp[target]
                    </code></pre>

                    You probably can’t, and neither can I! If there were a bug in it I honestly wouldn’t be able to find, let alone fix it.
                    I went through a phase of <em>over</em> optimizing everything while not commenting, wrongly thinking that less lines of code =
                    cleaner which bit me in the ass enough for me to stop that habit. My one advice to anyone who reads this and doesn’t
                    already is <strong>COMMENT!</strong>
